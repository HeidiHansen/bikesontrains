If more than one person is traveling on the same route, it is common to get a discounted ticket for the second passenger if you know where to look.  In NL, you have to make sure one rider has the 2nd rider discount privilege enabled on their card. This exists for NS business card holders, student card holders, and seasonal card holders.  Then, you can use the NS app or go to a ticket machine to purchase a ’Samenriseticket Dal’ fare for additional riders.
