according to eurostar: "Bikes can be taken on the direct train from London to Amsterdam departing from St Pancras International at 08:31 only.‚Äù
https://www.eurostar.com/us-en/travel-info/travel-planning/luggage/bikes
call eurostar to make a bike reservation at +44 (0) 344 822 5 822, or by emailing EuroDespatch@eurostar.com

the phone rep said there are three direct trains a day.

cannot do 1715.
can do 7:16am and 11:04am 
must drop bike off day before at luggage dispatch office. 
assembled bike is 55quid
if you book it far in advance, it costs less.  Since Im booking for wednesday it will cost 55.  if I go on the 1104 train, I must be there at least 90 minutes before.  there are only TWO assembled bike places per train.  if reserved in advance, it must be reserved at least 48 in advance over the phone.  The only way to do it sooner than that is in person at the station.  then I need to go to the station today.  Must go to the st pancras station.  Representative cannot see if there are any spaces available.  
you could drop your bike off one day and pick it up in amsterdam the next day.  there is availability on the 21st for the bike
i could go from london to brussels with the bike, then I would need to
eurostar would cover the cost of the damage for the bike.

German train site Bahn.de is the best for searching for trains and routes that allow bicycles.  Under 'further options', you can select ‚Äòonly show routes that allow bicycles‚Äô  This site will display train routes for most all of Europe.  Sometimes, you will be unable to purchase the ticket on the bahn site, but it is still the best site to begin with so that you may know if a train allows them at all.

Bicycles are allowed on all IC trains outside of peak travel hours.  Bicycles are never allowed to board IC trains during peak hours (Peak travel in NL is 06:00-09:00 and 16:00-18:30 Monday to Friday.  There are no peak hours on weekends.).  Bicycles can be carried onto trains at doors that have a bicycle logo on them, usually on the front and back of the train.

As of Sept 2019, Bicycles are not allowed on *any* ICE trains.  

For purposes of this document, I equate ‚Äòbicycle in bicycle bag‚Äô with ‚Äônot allowed‚Äô.  The ICE and Thalys specifically indicate that bicycles are allowed, but if you read the fine print, you will find that they are only allowed if they are boxed or in a bicycle bag with a maximum dimension size that is rather difficult to accommodate.  

Vakantiefietser sells bike covers that they call bike bags.  Their site says you can travel via plane or train with them.  I don‚Äôt understand what they mean. https://www.vakantiefietser.nl/praktische-tips/fiets-inpakken-in-een-fietsdoos/

Need to add something here about taking your bike on the train in Sweden when you traveled from Stockholm to the Nynasham ferry port.

There are many forms of bicycle tickets depending on the country you are traveling to, and you may need more than one at a time.  
* 24-hour bicycle tickets that are valid from 00:00 - 23:59 for the calendar day that you are traveling. Usable on any train in that country.  In NL, All local and IC trains permit bicycles with this type of ticket.  There are other train carriers that operate in NL that do not accept these tickets: DB, ICE, and Thalys are the ones I am aware of.
* International bicycle tickets, valid for the duration of your train ticket from the start point to the end point.  These simply allow you to have a bicycle with you during your international travel.  They do *not* guarantee that you will be permitted to bring you bicycle on any one particular leg of your journey because these tickets are not reservations for bicycle spaces on the trains.  They are simply a fee for traveling with a bicycle.  In Germany and Poland, these tickets must be printed out in advance before you travel.  Therefore, they must be mailed to you, or you must purchase them at the station before you depart.  They do not issue e-tickets for this.  You only need one per bicycle per trip, regardless of the number of transfers.  For example, if you are traveling from Poland to The Netherlands and will be changing trains twice, you may purchase an international bicycle ticket in Poland and reuse it for all transfers until you reach your destination in The Netherlands.
* Train-specific bicycle reservations.  In Poland and Germany, these are printed tickets and they are *required*.  Therefore, they must be purchased in advance online to be sent in the mail, or purchased at the station.  They are limited and first-come-first-serve.  If all bicycle reservations are taken, additional bicycles will not be permitted on the train.  The best way to ensure you will have a reservation, is to ask someone to go to the station for you in advance to purchase the ticket.  It‚Äôs 2019.  This is nonsense.

Additional tips:
If more than one person is traveling on the same route, it is common to get a discounted ticket for the second passenger if you know where to look.  In NL, you have to make sure one rider has the 2nd rider discount privilege enabled on their card. This exists for NS business card holders, student card holders, and seasonal card holders.  Then, you can use the NS app or go to a ticket machine to purchase a ‚ÄôSamenriseticket Dal‚Äô fare for additional riders.
